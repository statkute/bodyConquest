# Body Conquest

## Intro
Body conquest is a game I made with 4 other people as part of a 'Team Project' module during my second year at university.


## About
Our team was given a task to make a competitive game with the elements of artificial intelligence, physics and networking. After careful considerations, we decided to build a top-down, multiplayer strategy game in which two different diseases compete against each other to be the one who ultimately takes over the human body. It is called 'Body Conquest'.

One of the main reasons why we chose to designe this type of game is that, as a Team, we wanted to create something different and stand out from the existing games or from the games that other teams would develop. However, at the same time, we wanted to make sure that the end product would be a game that is interesting an, of course, fun to play. Intuitive game-play, complex combat system, short battle times and the multiplayer mode make sure that the user does not get bored quickly. Moreover, single player implementation allows a user to play in a more casual setting, without another person, in order to practice new strategies and tactics. When playing against the AI controlled opponent, the user can improve his or her skills even when their friends are not around which makes the game much more flexible. Furthermore, we wanted to make sure we create an immersive experience and thus put a lot of emphasis on the visuals. Many different, original and beautiful textures of maps and troops make the gaming experience even more enjoyable while making the game more appealing.
